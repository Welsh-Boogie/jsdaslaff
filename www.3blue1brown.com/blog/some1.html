former professor of mine, [Ravi Vakil](http://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~vakil/), put together a delightful picturebook explanation for how he likes to schematically visualize exact sequences. It's too delightful not to share, and he kindly let me throw it up here as a guest post ([pdf version here](/content/blog/exact-sequence-picturebook/PuzzlingThroughExactSequences.pdf)).\n\nThe target audience probably consists mostly of graduate students in mathematics, or else anyone who already has some familiarity with and reason to care about exact sequences, the snake lemma, cohomology, etc. This piece is not meant to introduce any of those, but in conjunction with traditional texts on the matters, it stands to be a very helpful companion.\n\nSuch topics rarely get bedtime stories, or strong visuals, which is part of what makes this such a gem.

The event\n\nIn the [last post](/blog/some1), I described a contest James Schloss and I organized meant to encourage more people to make online math explainers.\nThis could include videos, blog posts, games, or whatever else people might dream up.\nWe called it the Summer of Math Exposition, or SoME1.\n\nThe heart of the event was really a discord community, where people could trade notes, share their work, and otherwise engage with like-minded people interested in explaining some math concept online. The framing of having winners was primarily to align everyone around a common goal, with a common deadline, and a common set of principles for what constitutes a \"good\" math explainer.\n\nWe felt a bit of a tug and pull between the goal of making the contest easy to judge, and the goal of having people produce lessons that would be genuinely helpful to people. For example, shorter pieces are easiest to judge at a higher throughput, while quality lessons sometimes (though not always) take meaningful time. Using something like number of up-votes or likes would make for an easy first-pass filter, but runs the risk of punishing more niche content with very deliberate and specific target audience, or which has not yet built up any kind of audience.\n\nWe ended up with an event that was actually quite challenging to judge, but I like to think that this reflects a tendency to be relatively uncompromising on the main goal of encouraging people to make meaningful lessons. I can almost guarantee that anyone reading this will be able to find a lesson produces as part of this even which completely and utterly fascinates them.\n\n\n## The peer review process\n\nWe received over 1,200 submissions. While we set no explicit constraints on the length of entries, we did say that someone judging it should be able to assess its quality within 10 minutes. Realistically, I knew that for any I was going to consider as a final contender, I would probably want to spend more time on it, and to write some personalized feedback, so looking at all 1,200 was unfortunately untenable.\n\nFor a first pass, we had a peer review system. Naturally this raises all sorts of worrying questions. How do you know the system is fair? What if there are bad actors trying to manipulate it? What if people's judgements are not based on the principles we want to emphasize, but are based on more superficial properties like visual pizzazz?\n\nOne of the participants in the event actually wrote up [a post about this system](https://www.cantorsparadise.com/a-ranking-problem-b8ade5f001b?sk=b74871e2c36321f7e0bfdf8726b7d759), which is incredibly on-brand for a summer of math exposition, so I needn't repeat too much here. The system we used is called [Gavel](https://www.anishathalye.com/2016/09/19/gavel-an-expo-judging-system/), which is based on the Bradley-Terry algorithm for assigning rankings based on pairwise selections. You can read more about its design [here](https://www.anishathalye.com/2015/03/07/designing-a-better-judging-system/).\n\nWe told participants that to be considered for the final judgement, they would need to contribute 1 hour to the peer review process. The experience is to look at two pieces, let's call them A and B, then to simply decide on which is better, according to the [four principles](/blog/some1#how-will-winners-be-selected) laid out in the original announcement of the event. Then you're fed a third entry, C, and told to give a comparison of B and C, and so on. Behind the scenes there's an algorithm trying to be smart about which pieces it feeds you, building a model not just for the ranking of entries, but also for the trustworthiness of judges.\n\nDuring our process, there were around 13,000 total comparisons made in the system, and after about the first 7,000, the entries listed at the top 100 remained relatively stable. This gives some assurance that the rankings generated by this system were at least not random. And having looked at those 100 and more, I feel reassured that lower production quality but highly interesting lessons still managed to bubble toward the top.\n\nI use the phrase \"top 100\", but to be more precise the goal was to generated a list of 100 such that there's a very high likelihood that the top 5 were in that list. It seems entirely plausible that inefficiencies in the system could cause entries that should be ranked, say, 80-100, to instead mistakenly drop below. The failure mode we're really concerned with, though, is that one which should be ranked 5th somehow gets dropped below that top 100.\n\nThen again, the whole task is inherently subjective, so the premise of having an objective ranking, even in principle, is flimsy.\n\nOne systematic bias that was definitely at play is that some people thought it was a contest only for videos, and would down vote non-video entries accordingly. I'm not sure where this idea came from. Maybe it's only natural that a contest primarily announced on YouTube generates a YouTube-centric following. In an effort to combat this, James and I did look through many of the non-video entries which did not bubble up to that top 100.\n\n## Final judgements\n\nI reached out to a few friends in the community of math explanation to ask if they'd be willing to pitch in a little bit of time to looking through some of the final contenders, with the aim of making that final decision not rest too much on my own subjective opinions.\nOne got back to me mentioning how he'd love to help, but was really too busy that week. But then he watched just one minute of one entry out of curiosity...then a second minute...then the whole thing. Then another video, and another, and before too long had gotten sucked into more than I had originally asked for.\n\nIndeed, looking through these entries turned out to be very fun. I had a spreadsheet going, one row per entry, where in one column I simply wanted to answer \"is this likely going to be one of the best?\", yes or no. That is, a very high bar of quality should be set for saying yes in that column, so that for a second pass I could have just a small handful to choose between.\nHowever, as I started going through them all, that column's entries looks like \"yes, yes, probably, yes, maybe, yes, ...\" This was highly unhelpful for my future self, but again, indicative of how great these entries were.\n\nNone were perfect. I could easily see room for improvement in just about any I looked at (the same can be said for everything I make). For anyone thinking about putting together some kind of math explainer, I do want to emphasize that you shouldn't be worried about a need for it to be excellent in all respects. As long as it's a solid idea, with an engaging explanation, people will resonate with it.\n\nWhat made this most challenging in the end was just how apples-to-oranges it felt. One entry might be great because of the topic choice alone, while another stands out for a particular visual intuition in the middle, while yet another stands out for an unexpected application of a seemingly useless bit of math. How do you compare these to each other directly? How can you possibly choose 5 \"winners\" when you know deep down the premise of a winner is absurd?\n\n## The winners\n\nI just put out [a video](https://youtu.be/F3Qixy-r_rQ) announcing winners, which describes in more detail what it is I like about each one. But honestly, each speaks for itself, so I'd highly encourage you to take a look. In no particular order, here they are:\n\n+ [That weird light at the bottom of a mug — ENVELOPES](https://youtu.be/fJWnA4j0_ho)\n+ [Hiding Images in Plain Sight: The Physics Of Magic Windows](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/caustics-engineering)\n+ [The Beauty of Bézier Curves](https://youtu.be/aVwxzDHniEw)\n+ [What Is The Most Complicated Lock Pattern?](https://youtu.be/PKjbBQ0PBCQ)\n+ [Pick's theorem: The wrong, amazing proof](https://youtu.be/uh-yRNqLpOg)\n\nCollectively, these represent many of the qualities which I think makes for excellent math exposition, qualities like clarity, strong motivation, compelling choices of topic matter, and non-obvious insights.\n\n\n## All entries\n\nBut there are many, many more beyond these five which deserve your attention as well.\n\nWe put together a [YouTube playlist of all entries](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnQX-jgAF5pTkwtUuVpqS5tuWmJ-6ZM-Z), and listed below is a collection of all non-YouTube entries. In both cases, after an initially random ordering I tried to do some mild curation to put some of the entries I particularly enjoyed toward the top, but otherwise don't read too much into the order of the lists. Neither should be interpreted as a ranking, or anything like that.\n\n+ [mattferraro.dev/posts/caustics-engineering](https://mattferraro.dev/posts/caustics-engineering)\n+

This is a competition where anyone can submit a video, blog post, interactive game, or whatever else they dream up, and after the deadline we will select 5 to be featured in a 3blue1brown video.  Winners may also receive gold pi creatures.  I mean, probably not *gold* gold, but it would be something unique and emblematic of your greatness.\n\nFor the rest, we will put together a playlist of the video entries, and have a list of submissions on this website[^1].\nTo trade tips, share partial progress, and otherwise interact with others involved, join the [discord](https://discord.gg/Q3cC2GXN2f).\n\n\n\u003e _Note from August 22nd, 2021_: Submissions are now closed. We received over 1,300 entries, which is outstanding! Thank you to everyone who participated, we genuinely hope you keep producing online math explainers after this. We plan to announce winners by September 14th.\n\n\u003e _Note from July 19th, 2021_: Since announcing the contest, Brilliant came in to offer a total of $5,000 in cash prizes to be split among top entries. We'll split it evenly, allocating $1,000 each to the five entries selected to be featured in a video\n\n## Why do this?\nIt's hard to overstate how powerful it is when anyone can learn something they want just by searching online.  In a thousand subtle ways, when these explainers exist, projects go faster, school becomes easier, and math-phobia becomes a little bit less common.\n\nA lot of excellent lessons and intuitions stay confined to isolated classrooms, or worse, confined to some individual's head. It takes effort to make videos, or blog posts, and to put them out there. Here, we're hoping to offer a little bit of activation energy to anyone who has thought about doing something like this, but just never got around to it.\n\n\n## Who is this for?\nHonestly, anyone who might benefit others by sharing their knowledge.  This could include teachers who want to take what they've learned to work well in a classroom and put it online, students who want to deepen their own knowledge by putting together an explainer, mathematicians who want to get involved with outreach, engineers who want to share what mathematical tools they use on the job and how, etc.\n\nEntries from groups or teams are welcomed and encouraged too.\n\n## What are the constraints for entries?\n\n1. **It has to be something new you make this summer**\n\nThe spirit of this is to encourage people who've never put stuff online before.  If you want to work on something you sort of started once before, that's probably fine, but it can't be something you already published before this contest. Optimally, you'd use this as a chance to try something new you otherwise might not have.\n\n2. **It has to be about math.**\n\nHere we mean \"math\" very broadly, and more applied topics like physics or computer science are abundantly welcome.  It just has to be the case that a viewer/reader might come away knowing something mathematical they didn't before.\n\nThe topic could be at any level, whether that's basic math for young children or higher-level math.  If you're assuming a certain background level for the target audience, kindly mention it below.  It's hard because we don't want to discourage topics with a very niche target audience, as those lessons can sometimes be the most valuable.  However, if your lesson assumes particular expertise, e.g. a comfort with algebraic geometry, keep in mind that our judges may not fit into this category. So to actually win the contest, it's helpful if the topic is accessible to someone with, say, a background in standard undergrad math topics.\n\n3. **One entry per person/group**\n\nWe hope you make more, but we only have the capacity to judge participants based on a single entry.\n\n4. **It has to be available in English**\n\nIf you want to put out an explainer in another language, wonderful! Please do! But the judges here will be english speakers, so to be considered for the contest the lesson has to be accessible to them.\n\n5. **It has to be publicly visible and available for people to consume for free**\n\n## When is the deadline?\n\nAugust 22nd, 11:59pm PST\n\n\n## How will winners be selected?\nHere's what we're looking for:\n\n- **Clarity**: Jargon should be explained, the goals of the lesson should be understandable with minimal background, and the submission should generally display empathy for people unfamiliar with the topic.\n\n- **Motivation**: It should be clear to the reader/viewer within the first 30 seconds why they should care.\n\n- **Novelty**: It doesn't necessarily have to be an original idea or original topic, but it should offer someone an experience they might otherwise not have by searching around online.  Some of the greatest value comes from covering common topics in better ways. Other times there's value in surfacing otherwise obscure ideas which more people should know about.\n\n- **Memorable**: Something should make the piece easy to remember even several months later. Maybe it's the beauty of the presentation, the enthusiasm of the presenter, or the mind-blowingness of an aha moment.\n\nTo select the final winners, a small group of judges will look through the entries with the criteria above in mind.  Depending on the number of entries, we may have a step to pre-filter entries before these final judgments.  In all likelihood, to be considered for the competition, we may ask you to peer review some of the other participants' submissions. This would involve looking at five other entries and ranking them 1-5 based on how well they fit the criteria above, at which point we'll use the cumulative scoring which comes from those rankings to determine a final set of a few hundred which is manageable for our judges.\n\nFor longer works, judges might not be able to consume the full video/post.  Again, what's hard about this is that sometimes great explainers _are_ longer, such as a full lecture and we don't want to discourage those. Just understand that to select winners, there is only so much time, so the substance of your work should be clearly visible with a 5-10 minute view.\n\n## Advice\n\n[Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) made a delightful little comic encapsulating three of pieces of advice for math exposition mentioned in the video above.\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"comic-1.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"comic-2.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"comic-3.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"comic-4.png\" /\u003e\n\n## Other questions?\nWe'll update this page with more FAQs as they come in.  Feel free to ask below, or on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Blue1Brown/)\n\n[^1]: This only applies to good faith submissions, anything irrelevant or offensive would not be included\n","patrons":[],"title":"The Summer of Math Exposition","description":"Announcement for the SoME1 Competition","date":"2021-07-16T00:00:00.000Z","video":"ojjzXyQCzso","lastMod":"2022-10-02T17:21:50.436Z","sourceCode":"","empty":false,"slug":"some1","file":"/content/blog/some1/index.mdx","dir":"/content/blog/some1/","topic":"Uncategorized","thumbnail":"https://img.youtube.com/vi/ojjzXyQCzso/maxresdefault.jpg"},{"content":"\n\u003cFigure image=\"through-the-internet.png\" /\u003e\n\nMany schools around the world are still planning to run their classes and lectures remotely this fall, or at least to operate under a mix of distance and in-person classes. So all the usual balls that teachers and professors need to juggle, keeping students engaged, being responsive to their misconceptions, hitting all the points of a dense lesson plan, etc., are now supposed to be handled with all the awkwardness and impersonality of a video call.\n\nNo one seems to have phrased it this way, but effectively this year the world’s teachers were asked to become live streamers.\n\nA few weeks ago I collaborated with two friends to do an experimental set of [10 live-streamed math lectures](https://itempool.com/3b1b). Since then a number of teachers and professors have reached out asking about the setup I used, whether the live quizzing software made for those streams is available to others ([it is!](https://itempool.com/)), and for general thoughts on the whole distance learning process, so I wanted to share my answer in one place.\n\nDespite technically being a professional YouTuber, I certainly didn’t know what I was doing when I jumped into this. The first time I downloaded the broadcasting software to see what it was all about, I [accidentally streamed myself publicly for 3 seconds](https://youtu.be/Bdblmebf_QY). For any educators out there who feel as unaware of this stuff as I was, this is for you.\n\nThere’s actually a silver lining to every teacher suddenly being thrust into the role of a streamer. To the extent that your institution is comfortable with you recording and uploading your lessons publicly (which if you can, you should absolutely do), this year may end up providing the greatest influx of educational material to the internet that the world has ever seen.\n\nIf instead of thinking of remote classes as a more awkward form of a normal class, you view it as chance to practice video creation and turning your lessons into something more lasting and sharable, the benefit of handling this transition well may extend well beyond the education of this year’s students.\n\n## Software\n### OBS\nMost of the heavy lifting for live streaming is handled by a free broadcasting software called [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). There are other options, but this is a popular choice, and it’s what I used. It lets you organize various input sources, for example, cameras, microphones, or screen captures, and mix and match them to make various scenes. It’s very seamless to use with YouTube or Twitch, but you can also [connect OBS to Zoom](https://streamgeeks.us/how-to-connect-zoom-obs/), which is probably more relevant to most teachers.\n\nFor example, in my lessons, I set up 5 basic scenes:\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"face-cam.png\" caption=\"A simple face camera\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"overhead.png\" caption=\"An overhead shot of pen and paper where I wrote out the lesson.\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"screen-capture.png\" caption=\"A screen capture used to show animations, graphs on Desmos, and coding examples\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"audience-questions.png\" caption=\"Questions from the audience\" /\u003e\n\u003cFigure image=\"live-quiz.png\" caption=\"The live quiz\" /\u003e\n\nIn OBS you can set up keyboard shortcuts, so I set up a few to associate certain keys under the lefthand of my keyboard with different scenes so that I could switch between them easily, potentially even while writing or gesturing with my right hand under the overhead camera. It may not have been quite as seamless as real live TV with a production team orchestrating the feed, but I think it can get abitrarily close with practice. The upshot is that the look and feel of a professional production is more accessible to an individual teacher than you might think.\n\n### Itempool\nThe tool used for the live quiz is part of [Itempool](https://itempool.com/), put together by two former coworkers of mine from Khan Academy. The way it worked is that I’d queue up a question on the screen, and students could go to a certain link (e.g. from their phones) to follow along with the quiz and answer questions. The statistics of how everyone was answering would show up in real time on the stream, where viewers would see bars showing the relative proportions for each answer. But until I flipped a switch to reveal, it was a mystery which answers corresponded to which bars.\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"itempool.png\" /\u003e\n\nTo get the bars overlaid on the stream, we set up a webpage that displays the real-time updated bars and a title on a transparent background. That way, making that webpage an input source to OBS and creating a scene that combines the face camera with that page gave the effect we wanted.\n\nAt the time, it was a very bespoke tool just for that series, but now things have been set up so that you too can create questions, and turn any set of questions you write into one of these live challenges by clicking \"administer live\". This sets up the link where you can send students as well as the link to the page you can overlay on the stream. Also, and I'll admit I'm biased because it was built by friends, the act of actually writing math questions on Itempool is a delight, especially given the integration with [MathLive](https://mathlive.io/).\n\nWhen you’re in a room alone talking to a camera, it’s hard to overstate how nice it is to see some connection with the fact that there are really students there, in that moment, interacting with what you’re providing them. Not to mention the value of seeing when there’s a misconception, and for the students to see that many others had the same misconception.\n\n### Desmos and Geogebra\nI expect many math teachers already know about [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/). It's an online graphing calculator that makes it very simple to whip up surprisingly complicated graphs. I found it abundantly useful for live presentations over a stream, and what's nice is that you can share the links of what you build so that students can play with them. For example, here is a [cobweb diagram](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nul32eaaa9) I put together for the lesson on power towers. Beyond the graphing calculator, they also have an abundance of classroom activities.\n\nOne other very powerful tool for making interactive demos that I made use of was [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/). For example, here is the \"[complex slide rule](https://www.geogebra.org/m/mbhbdvkr)\" that came up during the lecture on complex number fundamentals.\n\nOne potential benefit of classes becoming remote is how much more natural it becomes to use the best tools for interacting with math that the internet has to offer. Sure, in principle there's no reason that these tools couldn't also be used for in-person teaching, but shifting to a setting that is necessarily online already lowers the activation energy to make it happen.\n\n## Hardware\nAs far as the physical setup goes, let me start by saying most teachers don’t have to be too fancy about this. A simple webcam will do, along with whatever mechanism suits you best to show what you’re writing, whether that’s a tablet, an overhead camera, or a whiteboard behind you. What matters most is the lesson itself and your charismatic presence. To goal of any recording and streaming setup is to give you the flexibility to show whatever you want to show in that lesson with as little friction as possible.\n\nDuring my time at Khan Academy, I found using a Wacom tablet worked quite nicely, and I’ve also done casual remote lessons over a video call where my “overhead camera” was just a phone sitting on a stack of books.\n\nThat said, being a “professional” YouTuber, and not wanting to disgrace my people, I thought I’d try to do it right. Well, okay, phrased more honestly my buddy Ben Eater was kind enough to lend a bunch of equipment and to patiently explain the numerous things I didn't know about live action filming.\n\nHere’s what we used:\n\n- Two GH5 cameras, one rigged up on an overhead mount.\n- Two USB to HDMI converter adapter cables, which essentially make the cameras operate like webcams.\n- A set of studio lights\n- A lav mic (More specifically a Rode Lavalier Lapel Omni-Directional Condenser Microphone)\n- USB Audio Interface to take the feed from the mic to the computer (Focusrite Scarlett Solo)\n- Two monitors. One to see the OBS dashboard, the other used for screen captures, managing the live quiz, seeing comments from the audience, etc.\n\n\u003cFigure\n  image=\"hardware.png\"\n  caption=\"The masking tape on the desk was to know what region is inside the shot of the overhead cam, though even then I’d occasionally write off-screen. The sticky notes on the overhead camera rig let me know where to point in the air to reference links and things on the screen.\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003cFigure\n  image=\"hardware-2.jpeg\"\n  caption=\"The microphone in this shot was just a backup in case the lav mic failed on us for some reason.\"\n/\u003e\n\nAs a small technical note, for the first two streams we did, the audio was slightly out of sync with the video. Hooking up the microphone to feed through the same input source as the camera fixed this, but there are also options in OBS to force some kind of offset in the audio to account for any delays on the camera’s end. Just do a simple test recording where you clap or something like that to see if the same issue comes up for you.\n\nI would say, while for the most part being simple and barebones with the setup is fine, it's definitely worth having audio at a higher quality than what built-in computer or headphone microphones provide. I suspect part of the reason that video calls can be so much more exhausting than simply watching a video is that there’s a constant, albeit slight, strain to make out what people are saying.\n\nThis advice comes from the category of “do what I say, not what I do”. The earliest videos on my channel have terrible audio, and several of the early streams had some issue with the sound, whether it was being out of sync, being too quiet, or clipping. If you take the time to get it right early on, your students will be grateful.\n\n## Questions from the audience\nThe first stream we did had about 26,000 people watching, so the live chat was...not helpful. Actually, it was actively problematic given that people would just post the answers to the questions in there. To take questions from the audience in later streams, we switched instead to having people Tweet to a certain hashtag, which a buddy of mine then combed through to decide which ones were worth pulling up on the screen. The added barrier to contributing made it possible to comb through and the average thoughtfulness of each question was an order of magnitude higher.\n\nAdmittedly this part of the experience my not be as transferable for most teachers, but I do think there’s something generalizable in this. In any classroom environment, whether big, small, remote, or in-person, you want engagement and contributions from the students, but only in the right direction. A class full of ambient chatter is in some sense engaged, but without guidance, it’s unlikely to be in the direction of learning. Handling this remotely becomes a whole new ballgame, and it’s worth finding whatever way works for you to connect with the good questions without there being a distracting onslaught of chatter. If you have someone, perhaps a TA, who can comb through questions and feed you the good ones, put them to good use.\n\nAs far as integrating this with the setup, what was easiest was to have a shared google doc, with one of the OBS scenes taking a webpage input that simply pointed to the URL of that doc. To give the question being overlaid on the camera shot, we made the Google doc background pure green and applied a chroma key filter.\n\n## Other tips\nRehearse!\n\nEven for ordinary lectures, doing some kind of dry run always helps to make what’s written in your notes come out as smoothly as you intend. But when you’re using any kind of new technology, this goes triply.\n\nBecause I had set up the stream with these five different scenes, face, paper, screen capture, quiz, and audience question, running the lesson meant keeping each of these in mind. Which one am I on? Do I need to switch? And if I’m on the screen capture, what should be in the shot, the browser, an animation, or the terminal? Where are we in the live quiz right now? The goal should be for all of this to be second nature so as to stay most focussed on the lesson itself, and with a little practice, it can be.","patrons":[],"title":"Tips for setting up remote lessons","date":"2020-07-02T00:00:00.000Z","lastMod":"2022-10-02T17:21:50.432Z","sourceCode":"","empty":false,"slug":"livestream-setup","file":"/content/blog/livestream-setup/index.mdx","dir":"/content/blog/livestream-setup/","topic":"Uncategorized","thumbnail":"/favicons/share-thumbnail.jpg"},{"content":"\nMany people, especially college students, ask what books I recommend for learning math, but it's impossible to give a universal answer to such a question. Aside from the obvious fact that it depends on what exactly you want to learn, it's entirely possible for two students with similar backgrounds and goals to approach the same book, with one having a fantastic experience while the other is left perpetually banging their head against the page in confusion. Likewise, a book might work for you at one time in your life but not another.\n\nI've put together a small list of textbooks I've thoroughly enjoyed at some time in the past, with the added condition that each one stands out in some way from the surrounding body of math texts. Take each recommendation with a grain of salt, precisely because the pairing of a book to a learner can be so personal, and who I was when I read each of these may be fairly different from who you are now.\n\n\n## Books for college students and beyond\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Differential Forms: A Unified Approach\"\n  author=\"John Hubbard and Barbara Burke Hubbard\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0971576688\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3AkLNU7\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis is what I wish I learned from in my freshman year of college. Honestly, the third of it that is about linear algebra is one of the best linear algebra resources out there.\n\nIt doesn't pull any punches for the pure math students, but unlike many books with that target audience it stays grounded in frequent numerical examples and scientific applications. The culmination to the generalized Stokes' theorem, as well as the way to frame Maxwell's equations with differential forms, are particularly satisfying.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"An Introduction to Thermal Physics\"\n  author=\"Daniel Schroeder\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0201380277\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Thermal-Physics-Daniel-Schroeder/dp/0201380277/ref=as_li_ss_il?dchild=1\u0026keywords=thermal+physics\u0026qid=1600278073\u0026s=books\u0026sr=1-2\u0026linkCode=li3\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026linkId=3ffbf07a5e3f5b3544d1d4eb19f22b7d\u0026language=en_US\"\n/\u003e\n\nDespite my aim to keep this list purely about math books, I cannot help but include this one in the list. Simply put, it's one of the most enjoyable textbooks I've ever read, giving a very satisfying first-principles understanding of what thermodynamic concepts like temperature and entropy really are, and how we can to understand them.\n\nStatistical mechanics is all about taking surprisingly minimal assumptions, and mathematically analyzing the life out of them to explain where the laws of thermodynamics come from. I feel all math students should at least expose themselves to this topic, if for no other reason than to see what powerful results can come from simple combinatorics. There's also value in practicing what it feels like to take a complicated expression, write an approximation that capture the core part that really matters, and use it to make experimental predictions about insanely complicated systems.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Visual Complex Analysis\"\n  auothors=\"Tristan Needham\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0198534469\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3jgBs4B\"\n/\u003e\n\nAs the title suggests, this offers a highly pictorial introduction to complex analysis. I would not use this as the _only_ text to learn about complex analysis, but Needham does a marvelous job of conveying the beauty of the subject, with numerous helpful intuitions for otherwise famously tricky ideas.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Visual Group Theory\"\n  author=\"Nathan Carter\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=088385757X\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3AbxXTT\"\n/\u003e\n\nAnother text with a titular promise to focus on pictures, this one tackles a subject which is more commonly taught purely symbolically. One of the most important things for any student learning about groups to understand is just how many different ways there are to think about a group, and how different views might be helpful in different contexts. Again, I wouldn't use this as the only book to understand the topic, but it offers a refreshingly different perspective on the topic from most others out there to help arm your arsenal of intuitions.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Proofs from the book\"\n  author=\"Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=3662572648\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/2Vw1vwb\"\n/\u003e\n\nIf you like clever proofs, this is the book for you. It's filled with some of the most elegant arguments in math, taken from combinatorics, geometry, graph theory, analysis, set theory and more. I can't think of any other books with a higher density of \"aha\" moments.\n\nElegant proofs can often be difficult to understand due to their density, but Aigner and Ziegler skillfully set the stage for each argument to make it more understandable. There are also numerous helpful illustrations in the margin which help elucidate the charm in all the proofs they've collected.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos\"\n  author=\"Steven Strogatz\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0813349109\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/2Vixu3n\"\n/\u003e\n\nSteven Strogatz is one of the most well known math communicators, and for good reason. He has a way of making you love a problem before diving into telling you how it's solved. Chaos is an incredibly fascinating field, which has only emerged relatively recently in the history of math. This is the well-deserved gold standard for understanding what it's all about.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Ordinary Differential Equations\"\n  author=\"Vladimir Arnold\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B0046I9D6E\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/2Vbc1cJ\"\n/\u003e\n\nIf you want to understand differential equations, but more from the pure math side of things, Arnold gives a wonderful picture of what the field is all about, with a mixture of high level intuitions and low level details, with a satisfying focus on visual and physical intuition along the way.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"The Art Of Probability\"\n  author=\"Richard Hamming\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0201406861\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3lr7qxC\"\n/\u003e\n\nHamming was a practitioner, spending much of his career in Bell Labs, so unlike many books on probability this stays grounded in the kind of intuitions which come up a lot in solving practical problems. It has countless helpful puzzles and problem solving tricks which are organized in such a way as to give a sense for the deeper theory underlying probability and statistics.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms\"\n  author=\"David MacKay\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0521642981\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3je4OjY\"\n/\u003e\n\nInformation theory has a way of shaping the way you view many things in math, computer science, physics and beyond. It's one of those fields that takes ideas which you wouldn't think of as being quantifiable or rigorous, and makes them so.\n\nTo be honest, my _first_ recommendation for anyone looking to learn about information theory is to read [Shannon's original paper](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) on the topic. After that, for a fuller view of what it's become, MacKay's book is fantastic.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"The Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class\"\n  author=\"J. Michael Steele\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=052154677X\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/37hfVD5\"\n/\u003e\n\nThe strength of this book is the central role it places on problems. It's aim is to teach you about inequalities, which are the backbone of analysis. But it's all-too easy to teach the statement of an inequality without conveying the intuition for when and how you'd use it. By focusing on well chosen puzzles, this book does an admirable job circumventing that risk and leaving you with the feeling of having trained a skill, rather than having learned a list of facts.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Fourier Analysis: An Introduction\"\n  author=\"Elias Stein and Rami Shakarchi\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B003V4BQ46\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/2WIv0vo\"\n/\u003e\n\nNot only is this a wonderful foundation for Fourier analysis, with a surprising and satisfying application to prime numbers given in the last chapter, it's a good starting point for analysis as a whole. Stein and Shakarchi have a series of four excellent books on the foundations of analysis, based on a now-famous series of lectures given at Princeton.\n\n - [Fourier Analysis](https://amzn.to/2WIv0vo)\n - [Real anlysis](https://amzn.to/3fKQlLF)\n - [Complex analysis](https://amzn.to/37kzg6m)\n - [Functional analysis](https://amzn.to/2Vvfq5W)\n\nAnalysis, in all its forms, can be very tricky to wrap your mind around, and very fiddly to work with in trying to form airtight proofs and definitions. This set of books, though, is a good place to start for anyone feeling ambitious.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Primes of the Form x^2 + n y^2\"\n  author=\"David A. Cox\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=1118390180\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3Caxsez\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis might seem like a bizarrely specific question to write a whole book about, but that's actually the charm. It covers deep and general ideas, such as class field theory and elliptic functions, which are usually only taught to graduate students, but Cox approaches it all from an extremely concrete question which Fermat thought about.\n\nThe typical culture in modern math texts, especially graduate texts, is to first build up an abstract theory, with indications of what you can do with these constructions appearing as offhanded as exercises or examples later on. In any other book on class field theory, the question of which primes can be expressed as $x^2 + n y^2$ for a particular $n$ would be some exercise sitting in the back of a later chapter, easily ignored. The fact that Cox puts one little example so front-and-center as to be the title reflects his general adherence to strong motivation before any abstraction.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"The Princeton Companion to Mathematics\"\n  author=\"Timothy Gowers (and many, many others)\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0691118809\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/2WR4foN\"\n/\u003e\n\nBooks can never replace the intuition available if there's a professor down the hall whose door you can knock on to start asking questions. However, this book gets pretty close.\n\nWhere it shines is in section IV, which includes many expository introductions to various fields of modern math. If there's a field of research you've heard of, say something like analytic number theory, and you're curious to get a feel for what it's all about, the corresponding essay in that section is likely to do a fantastic job.\n\n---\n\nFor any textbooks that you read, try to avoid being passive. Read with a pencil and paper in hand to jot down notes and work on exercises (yes, you should actually do the exercises!). Try to predict what proofs will look like before reading them. Be willing to meditate on what the right way to think about a given object is, and ask what would happen if definitions were tweaked.\n\nAsk yourself if each new construct feels motivated, or if it's out of the blue. If it is out of the blue, it's okay to move forward anyway, just keep note of the fact that there is a lurking question mark.\n\nAlso, although it’s not quite a book, you may also enjoy the [expository papers](https://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/) written by Keith Conrad, especially if you’re looking to learn group theory or number theory.\n\n## Pre-college\n\nThe recommendations above are targeted at those in college or beyond. There are undoubtedly many great books for those in high school and below, but I feel less well-positioned to give recommendations in that direction. It was really only once I got to college that I began learning meaningfully from math books, with more of my learning before then coming from interactions with teachers, poking around online, and getting lost in my own head.\n\nThat's not to say I didn't learn from books at all before then, there are a handful of texts such as the original [Art of Problem Solving](https://amzn.to/3xrv5QJ) books which were very influential. And when I was younger I remember a certain fascination with many of [the](https://amzn.to/3yu1UOE) [wooden](https://amzn.to/3lu82Tm) [books](https://amzn.to/3luq33M) my dad gave me. But part of me feels like the best thing for any young learner will be a set of good problems to chew on, more so than a set of good books.\n\n\n## Popular books\n\nThere are countless wonderful works out there about math aimed at the general public. Here's just a very small handful which I’d recommend taking a look at.\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Chaos: Making a New Science\"\n  author=\"James Gleick\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0143113453\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3jnG4FW\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis is one of my all-time favorite books, closely followed by everything else Gleick has written. It gives an inspiring look at the birth of a new field, and unlike many popular science books it manages to talk substantively about the math which was being discovered.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Change Is the Only Constant: The Wisdom of Calculus in a Madcap World\"\n  author=\"\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0316509086\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/3fLOupV\"\n/\u003e\n\nIf you haven't already come across [math with bad drawings](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/), you're severely missing out.\n\nI feel like Ben Orlin solved what was previously an unsolved problem with this book: Teach calculus in a way which is as enjoyable to those unfamiliar with the topic as it is to experts who use it every day. I, for one, was laughing from page 1. One of the more delightful aspects of this book is how Orlin doesn't just draw from the usual suspects like physics and economics to get practical insight about calculus, he also looks to history, poetry, literature, and swimming corgis.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Infinite Powers: How Calculus Reveals the Secrets of the Universe\"\n  author=\"\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0358299284\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"(https://amzn.to/2VcGxmB)\"\n/\u003e\n\nThis is another wonderful book aiming to popularize calculus (2019 was a good year for that goal). What I enjoyed about this one is how broad a view Strogatz takes of the origins of calculus, ranging from the clever proofs Archimedes was developing up to Fourier's study of heat.\n\n---\n\n\u003cBook\n  title=\"Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors\"\n  author=\"\"\n  image=\"https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=0141989149\u0026Format=_SL250_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026tag=3b1b04-20\u0026language=en_US\"\n  url=\"https://amzn.to/2VumlMs\"\n/\u003e\n\nLeave it to Matt Parker to write an entire book about making mistakes in math.\n","patrons":[],"title":"Book recommendations","date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","lastMod":"2022-10-02T17:21:50.352Z","sourceCode":"","empty":false,"slug":"book-recommendations","file":"/content/blog/book-recommendations/index.mdx","dir":"/content/blog/book-recommendations/","topic":"Uncategorized","thumbnail":"/favicons/share-thumbnail.jpg"},{"content":"\nIf there’s one thing I hope 3blue1brown videos do, it’s to inspire people to spend more time playing with and learning about math. In a [separate post](/blog/book-recommendations), I lay out some recommendations for books on math which I've personally enjoyed. Here I thought I'd list some of the other places online you might enjoy exploring, should you find yourself with an itch for more math.[^1]\n\n## Practice\nPassive consumption, say by watching videos or reading books, is certainly the lowest friction way to expose yourself to new math. But if you care about long-term retention and deeper understanding, there really is no substitute for practice. So before getting to other YouTube channels and books you might enjoy, here are a few places you can go to learn more actively.\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"brilliant.png\" width=\"150px\" /\u003e\n\nThe first is [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org/). I know a few of the people there, and I can vouch for the fact that they are extremely thoughtful about what makes for good learning. It shows in the product. Rather than putting lectures and videos front and center, problems and puzzles take precedence, all presented in a structured progression. The site also benefits from an active and helpful community of users.\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"aops.png\" width=\"150px\" /\u003e\n\nAnother good reservoir of problems with a helpful community surrounding them is the [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/). In particular, they have an extensive [archive of contest math problems](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c13_contests), ranging from more approachable ones like the AMC8 to extremely hard ones like the IMO, all with excellent surrounding discussion from the community.\n\nThe original [Art of Problem Solving book](https://artofproblemsolving.com/store/item/aops-vol1) by Richard Rusczyk, by the way, was one of the things that made me fall in love with creative math as a young student.\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"mathigon.png\" width=\"150px\" /\u003e\n\n[Mathigon](https://mathigon.org/) is a very beautifully done set of interactive articles on all sorts of fun topics in math. The experience sits somewhere between reading and playing a game, with a really wonderful blend of artwork, technology and pedagogical clarity. One small feature, but which adds a ton in my opinion, is that you have to answer questions in order to continue reading. It's a nice way to force the reader to be honest with themselves about whether they're being passive or not.\n\n\u003cFigure image=\"khan.png\" width=\"150px\" /\u003e\n\nFor building up your fundamentals, say starting with algebra, take a look at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). They are probably most famous for the videos Sal does, but arguably the site is most valuable as a source of problems you can drill on, starting from the very basics if necessary. I may be biased, though, given that I used to work there!\n\n## Other YouTube channels\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/mathologer.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Mathologer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1_uAIS3r8Vu6JjXWvastJg), by Burkard Polster. Half of the appeal here comes from the delightful bits of math this channel covers, often with novel ways of presenting otherwise extremely complicated topics to make them easier. For example, he has a video showing [why $\\pi$ is transcendental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyoH_vgiqXM), which is a famously difficult topic, but which he skillfully boils down into an approachable step-by-step presentation. The other half of the appeal is watching Burkard delightedly laugh at his own jokes every 2 minutes or so.\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/numberphile.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile), by Brady Haran. I’m guessing if you’re here, you already know about Numberphile. If somehow you don’t, it’s a great channel full of interviews with mathematicians. As a result, you see a wide array of the types of topics which different mathematicians find exciting to showcase or teach, and a little more of the human element behind this subject. There is also an [associated podcast](https://www.numberphile.com/podcast), less about the math, and more about those human stories.\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/stand-up-maths.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Standup Maths](https://www.youtube.com/user/standupmaths), by Matt Parker. This channel is more whimsical and comedic, but that’s not to say there isn’t a lot of serious math it covers.\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/looking-glass-universe.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Looking Glass Universe](https://www.youtube.com/user/LookingGlassUniverse), by Mithuna Yoganathan. She covers ideas from physics and math explained simply and unusually honestly. Start with the [one on spin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd2Ua9dKEl8), it’s great. She also places an emphasis on doing practice, often assigning “homework” at the end of each video.\n\nAlso, can we just step back to appreciate that the four channels above are all run by people either from or based in Australia? What’s going on over there? And that’s not even counting [Tibees](https://www.youtube.com/user/tibees), [Eddy Woo](https://www.youtube.com/user/misterwootube), [James Tanton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCib_J32VI8rQI_LCFXn1XAA) and countless others.\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/welch-labs.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Welch Labs](https://www.youtube.com/user/Taylorns34), by Stephen Welch. Perhaps best known for his [series on imaginary numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T647CGsuOVU\u0026list=PLiaHhY2iBX9g6KIvZ_703G3KJXapKkNaF), this channel is full of high production quality and well-written videos. There are also several series on machine learning, the topics underlying self-driving cars, so this is certainly one of the more applied math channels out there.\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/bprp.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Black pen red pen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_SvYP0k05UKiJ_2ndB02IA), by Steve Chow. If you like seeing how to work out integrals in all sorts of crazy ways, boy is this the channel for you. Steven is a math teacher, and the videos have a feeling of being in office hours, honestly working through problems with a very skillful and enthusiastic teacher. Many of the problems covered are the kind you might come across in school, and many or just for fun.\n\n---\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/recommendations/patrickjmt.jpeg\" /\u003e\n\n[Patrick JMT](https://www.youtube.com/user/patrickJMT), by… well… Patrick. If you want good, honest worked examples of practice problems, especially for calculus, it’s hard to find a deeper well of examples than what this channel provides.\n\n\u003cbr /\u003e\n\n---\n\nNeedless to say, there are countless others. But often less is more when it comes to recommendations, so let's leave things here for the time being.\n\n\n[^1]: Some of the companies listed above have sponsored 3blue1brown videos in the past, but the recommendations here are not sponsored or advertisements in any way.","patrons":[],"title":"Recommendations","date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","lastMod":"2022-10-02T17:21:50.432Z","sourceCode":"","empty":false,"slug":"recommendations","file":"/content/blog/recommendations/index.mdx","dir":"/content/blog/recommendations/","topic":"Uncategorized","thumbnail":"/favicons/share-thumbnail.jpg"},{"content":"\n#### (Note from many years later)\n\nFor whatever reason, when I first started 3blue1brown, I also found myself jotting down silly math poems on the side. Math is often most naturally expressed with symbols or pictures, and words are a more tricky medium, so something about the added constraint of making those words adhere to certain meters or rhyming structures felt like a fun puzzle, albeit an unabashedly cheesy one.\n\nAfter I made the first couple of 3blue1brown videos, and put together a website with some vague sense that that's what I was supposed to do, I tossed up the poems to that site while I was at it. Even if they seem a bit strange now, I still find a certain charm in leaving them here as a remnant of that early-2015 mindset associated with trying something wacky and throwing it up online, which was the same mindset which led to the channel in the first place.\n\n\n## Moser's Circle Problem\n\n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/poems/circ2.png\" /\u003e\n\nTake two points on a circle,  \nand draw a line straight through.  \nThe space that was encircled  \nis divided into two.  \n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/poems/circ4.png\" /\u003e\n\nTo these points add a third one,  \nwhich gives us two more chords.  \nThe space through which these lines run  \nhas been fissured into four.  \n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/poems/circ8.png\" /\u003e\n\nContinue with a fourth point,  \nand three more lines drawn straight.  \nThe new number of disjoint  \nregions sums, in all, to eight.  \n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/poems/circ16.png\" /\u003e\n\nA fifth point and its four lines  \nsupport this pattern gleaned.  \nCounting sections, one divines  \nthat there are now sixteen.  \n\n\u003cPortrait image=\"/content/blog/poems/circ31.png\" /\u003e\n\nThis pattern here of doubling  \ndoes seems a sturdy one.  \nBut one more step is troubling  \nas the sixth gives thirty-one.  \n\n## Primes\nThe primes,  \nthrough times,  \n\nmystified  \nthose who pried.  \n\nOne fact answers why  \nthey’re simple yet sly:  \n\nLayers of abstraction yield  \ncomplex forms when pierced and peeled.  \n\nAddition lies under multiplication,  \ndefining him as repeated summation.  \n\nThen he defines primes as the atoms of integers,  \nfor when multiplied, they give numbers their signatures.  \n\nBut when we breach the layer between these two distinct operations,  \nasking about how primes add and subtract, there are endless frustrations.  \n\nEven innocuous questions, “what are all their sums?”, or “how often do they differ by two?”,  \nstump everyone who has ever lived, with progress made only quite recently by just a few.  \n\nHowever, to recruit for and progress math we need to have such questions which can be phrased simply and remain unsolved.  \nWhat child does not hear such conjectures and dream, if only for a moment, that they will be the one to see them resolved?  \n\nFor otherwise the once vigorous curiosity of a child towards math’s patterns, as they grow older, tends to grow tame,  \njust as the rhyme and rhythm of the primes seems to fade as numbers grow, though in both the underlying patterns remain the same.  \n\n## All Numbers are Interesting\nIs any number that we count banal,  \nand lacking in a feature one might note?  \nSuppose some are, and gather up them all.  \nThe smallest one has quite the cause to gloat.  \nIt is precisely how far one must count  \nbefore the numbers get uninteresting.  \nBut this would be a curious amount,  \nwhich contradicts how we defined the thing!  \nSo every number has something to show,  \nincluding ones whom we will never know.  \n\nLet’s see if this joke proof applies as well  \nto real numbers; do they all stand out?  \nSuppose some don’t, and find one who rebels  \nby being meaningful beyond a doubt.  \nBefore it was the smallest who amused,  \nbut real sets might lack a minimum.  \nWill there be a special one to choose  \nfrom subsets of the whole continuum?  \nIt isn’t clear where such a choice comes from,  \nyet some treat “choice” like it’s an axiom.  \n\n## Invention vs Discovery\nA lurking question, old as Greece, does ask:  \nIs math invention or discovery?  \nThe answer’s both, but here the harder task  \nis knowing how it switches.  So you see,  \nmost truths are found with constructs, which in turn  \nare built from truths like chickens and their eggs.  \nOne needs to know, should this fact raise concern,  \nthat constructs can be daft; just logic’s dregs.  \nThe truths discovered tell how to define  \nthe structures that make math and world align.  \n\nPythagoras’s theorem about lengths,  \nis one such truth that he (and others) found.  \nObserved, discovered, and through mental strength,  \nit was then proved with pictures that astound.  \nMuch later mathematicians, minds alit,  \nwould formalize, as sets, both “length” and “space”.  \nThese constructs were defined so that by writ  \nPythagoras’s truth remains the case.  \nThat is, this “theorem” now seems just defined.  \nAs such, one might then lose their peace of mind.  \n\nSo in this world where \"space\" is formalized,  \ndo all those pretty proofs now lose their charm?  \nOf course not!  We all ought to realize  \nhow “length” could change its meaning without harm  \nto mathematical consistency  \nin all the theory giving facts of space.  \nHowever, then these “facts” would hardly be  \nrelated to the nature we embrace.  \nAnd hence, a truth has told how to define  \na structure that makes math and world align.  \n\n## 2π\nFixed poorly in notation with that two,  \nyou shine so loud that you deserve a name.  \nLate though we are, to make a change it's true,  \nWe can extol you ‘til you have pi's fame.  \nOne might object, \"Conventions matter not!  \nGreat formulae cast truths transcending names.\"  \nI've noticed, though, how language molds my thoughts;  \nthe natural terms make heart and head the same.  \nSo lose the two inside your autograph,  \nthen guide our thoughts without you \"better\" half.  \n\nWonders math imparts become so neat  \nwhen phrased with you, and pi remains off-screen.  \nSine and exp both cycle to your beat.  \nJive with Fourier, and forms are clean.  \n“Wait! Area of circles”, pi would say,  \n“sticks oddly to one half when tau’s preferred.”  \nMore to you then!  For write it in this way,  \nthen links to triangles can be inferred.  \nNix pi, then all within geometry  \nshines clean and clear, as if by poetry.  \n\n## 1-1+1-1+...\nWhen one takes one from one  \nplus one from one plus one  \nand on and on but ends  \nanon then starts again,  \nthen some sums sum to one,  \nto zero other ones.  \nOne wonders who'd have won  \nhad stopping not been done;  \nhad he summed every bit  \nuntil the infinite.  \n\nLest you should think that such  \nless well-known sums are much  \nado about nonsense  \nI do give these two cents:  \nThe universe has got  \nan answer which is not  \nwhat most would first surmise,  \nit is a compromise,  \nand though it seems a laugh  \nthe universe gives “half”.  \n\n## Defining Math\nIn math, we strive and stickle with a pride,  \nto wash away all ambiguity.  \nAnd yet, definers cannot all decide  \nwhat “math” itself means.  What an irony!  \nPerhaps a science, solving mysteries,  \nbut happy to pursue what seems absurd.  \nPerhaps a brother of philosophies,  \nbut with a rigid rigour in each word.  \nComputer science might be suitable,  \nbut most of math is not computable.  \n\nPerhaps it is a language of its own,  \nwhich, as to english, has the most false friends.  \nPerhaps religion, where the truth alone  \nis worshiped, giving means as well as ends.  \nPerhaps a sister of creative arts,  \nbut one arousing reason, not a sense.  \nIndeed it shares a number of its parts  \nwith almost every study in some sense.  \nBut it’s an orphan, floating in abstract,  \nand it alone encloses what’s exact  \n\n## Euler's Formula\nFamously  \nstart with e,  \nraise to π  \nwith an i.  \nwe've been taught  \nby a lot  \nthat you've got  \nminus one.  \n\nCan we glean  \nwhat it means?  \nFor such words  \nare absurd.  \nHow to treat  \nthe repeat  \nof a feat  \nπi times?  \n\nThis is bound  \nto confound  \n'til your mind  \nredefines  \nthese amounts  \none can't count  \nwhich surmount  \nour friend e.  \n\nNumbers act  \nas abstract  \nfunctions which  \nslide the rich  \n2d space  \nin its place  \nwith a grace  \nwhen they sum.  \n\nMultiplied,  \nthey don’t slide,  \nacting a  \nsecond way.  \nThey rotate,  \nand dilate,  \nbut keep straight  \nthat same plane.  \n\nNow what we  \nwrite as e  \nto the x  \nwon’t perplex  \nwhen you know  \nit’s for show  \nthat “x\" goes  \nup and right.  \n\nIt does not,  \nas you thought,  \nrepeat e  \nproduct e.  \nIt functions  \nwith gumption  \non functions  \nof the plane.  \n\nIt turns slides  \nside to side  \ninto growths  \nand shrinks both.  \nUp and downs  \ncome around  \nas turns round,  \nwhich is key!  \n\nThis is why  \nπ times i,  \nwhich slides north  \nis brought forth  \nand returned,  \nwe have learned,  \nas a turn  \nhalfway round.  \n\nMinus one,  \nmatched by none,  \nturns this way,  \nhence we’re done.  \n\n## Ode To Infinity\nPhilosophers have claimed you are not \"real\",  \nbut you are no less true than 3, in fact.  \nFor what is \"three\"?  Some thinking will reveal,  \na term that points to triplets in abstract.  \nAnd so are you, a pointer in this light,  \nbut aimed instead at families without size.  \nFrom here it took great Cantor's mental sight  \nto see these sets disjoin before his eyes.  \nFor that's the tricky thing about you, friend,  \nwhat you are is something without end!  \n\nAside from all the masks you wear as sets,  \nyou permeate all math like pi and e.  \nWithout you series, sequences and nets,  \nwould vanish, as would all geometry.  \nTo cook the real numbers all it takes,  \nis you and all the fractions to react.  \nWhen added as a simple point you make  \nboth arguments and spaces more compact.  \nWhen patterns, lists and odes drag on and on,  \njust say \"infinity\", and woes are gone.  \n\n## Groups\n\"What is a group?\"  \n    “A symmetry of things.”  \n\n“Of things from where?”  \n    “Oh, those from any place.”  \n\n“But where in math?”  \n    “In math?  A vector space.”  \n\n“And what is that?”  \n    “It’s what a field brings.”  \n\n“And what are fields?”  \n    “They’re Symmetries of groups.”  \n\n“A group’s own group?”  \n    “Why yes, when both are one.”  \n\n“So now we’re back?”  \n    “Indeed, where we’d begun.”  \n\n“So where to start?”  \n    “Where you start any loop.”  \n\n“And where is that?”  \n    “From anywhere within.”  \n\n“And if you're out?”  \n    “Then why would you begin?”  \n\n## Abstraction\nThe crux of thought,  \ncomputer science,  \nlanguage, and how math arose,  \nabstraction brought  \na key alliance  \nsyncing facts who seem opposed.  \n\nThe first is how  \nour minds are tuned to  \nfocus on at most one thought.  \nThough well endowed,  \nthey’re not immune to  \npuzzlement when overwrought.  \n\nBut secondly  \nthe facts of nature  \ninterweave dependently,  \nso how do we  \nconceive this nature  \nin its multiplicity?  \n\nWe first extract  \na common trait  \nof things too complex to be known,  \nthen to “abstract”,  \nreformulate  \nthis trait as *something in its own*.  \n\nAs such it’s pulled  \nfrom all distractions,  \nsingle, hence conceivable.  \nBut when minds hold  \nthis dense abstraction,  \nThey enclose a system whole.  \n\nFor “things” and their “traits”,  \nthough separately named,  \ndo more than relate:  \nThey’re one and the same.  \n","patrons":[],"title":"Math Poetry","date":"2015-03-03T00:00:00.000Z","lastMod":"2022-10-02T17:21:50.432Z","sourceCode":"","empty":false,"slug":"poems","file":"/content/blog/poems/index.mdx","dir":"/content/blog/poems/","topic":"Uncategorized","thumbnail":"/favicons/share-thumbnail.jpg"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/blog/[slug]","query":{"slug":"some1"},"buildId":"hufd_OwzWQrc5fSjC3t8D","runtimeConfig":{},"isFallback":false,"gsp":true}</script><script nomodule="" src="../_next/static/chunks/polyfills-dd33024d0daf1a08f7e2.js"></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/webpack-06b4e8735b591f9f2672.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/framework.bc6c2ec3e69fd2978ea6.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/commons.208ad5033da37dccf4c3.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/main-3714b5a7244acd786eda.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/2c5bbc8354af684dadf48493aef12e8f4509049f_CSS.0a0b70788b6411282e55.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-76171caeaf9f22b3b672.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/b5f2ed29.b31afee944bbc0d1d8d8.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/03768099e8e8d1bba11e419e84678c668d283287.e6ce23026cd4d83471d8.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/03768099e8e8d1bba11e419e84678c668d283287_CSS.a83a6a4548b93404854d.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/chunks/pages/blog/%5bslug%5d-43ada959be90e8b18b17.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/hufd_OwzWQrc5fSjC3t8D/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="../_next/static/hufd_OwzWQrc5fSjC3t8D/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body>
